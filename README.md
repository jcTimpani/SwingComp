Drumset Music Generator
The Drumset Music Generator is a web-based tool designed to generate dynamic comping patterns for jazz swing beats. Users can customize the difficulty level, select different voices (snare, bass, or both), and control the number of measures generated for practice. This tool helps drummers practice and improve their rhythm and coordination by generating new and random rhythmic patterns for every session.

Features
Difficulty Levels: Choose from three different difficulty levels.
Level 1: Only generates notes on the downbeats (beats 1, 2, 3, and 4).
Level 2: Generates notes on the downbeats and the third partial of triplets.
Level 3: Generates notes on all triplets (full complexity).
Voice Selection: Choose whether to generate only snare, only bass, or both.
Custom Measures: Specify how many measures of music you want to generate.
Random Patterns: Every time you generate a new pattern, the rhythm changes randomly, helping drummers practice a variety of comping rhythms.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the user interface.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript (VexFlow): For generating and rendering the drumset sheet music.
